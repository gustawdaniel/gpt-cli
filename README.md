# Gpt Cli

Linux terminal GPT3 integration with killer prompt that skip descriptions and other human-readable bullshit. It shows
you commands that can be executed by `ENTER`.

## Example:

You typing:

```
p show me my graphic cards
```

You will see:

```
lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"
```

After `ENTER` you will see

```
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Alder Lake-P Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0c)
        Subsystem: CLEVO/KAPOK Computer Device 65f5
        Kernel driver in use: i915
--
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GA106M [GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q] (rev a1)
        Subsystem: CLEVO/KAPOK Computer Device 67f5
        Kernel driver in use: nvidia
```

## More powerful every day

From v0.0.8 it supports context overriding. Default system context is

> Imagine you are linux terminal command selector. I will describe task, and you will respond only using linux command,
> without description, without explanation.

Default postprocess mode is `confirm`. It shows answer and asking if it should be executed.

But you can use it in other use-cases. To translate texts:

```
GPT_SYSTEM_PROMPT="I am translator from polish to english. I need to translate this text." GPT_POST=copy p Witaj Å›wiecie
```

You can redirect it to file set these environment variables as permanent.

```
export GPT_SYSTEM_PROMPT="I am translator from polish to english. I need to translate this text."; export GPT_POST=out;
```

and then translate using:

```
p "$(cat polish.txt)" > english.txt
```

To back do default

```
unset GPT_SYSTEM_PROMPT; unset GPT_POST
```

Possible values:

- `GPT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - any string that will explain gpt3 how to behave.
- `GPT_POST`
    - confirm - default, will ask if execute output in terminal
    - copy - will copy your answer to terminal clipboard
    - out - will print answer on standard output - usefully for further processing

## Installation

There are few options

### Shell

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gustawdaniel/gpt-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

it will save `gpt-cli` and alias `p` in `/usr/local/bin` so this is why it require sudo.

### Cargo

```
cargo install gpt-cli
ln -s ~/.cargo/bin/gpt-cli ~/.cargo/bin/p
```

### Docker

```
alias p="docker run -v ~/.gpt-cache.json:/.gpt-cache.json -e GPT3_API_KEY=${GPT3_API_KEY} gustawdaniel/gpt-cli"
```

In Docker, you can't use flag `GPT_POST` and it is automatically set as `out`. It means that you can't confirm command
by `ENTER` and commands will not be copied to your clipboard.

## Complication from source

```
git clone https://github.com/gustawdaniel/gpt-cli && cd gpt-cli 
cargo build --release
sudo cp ./target/release/gpt-cli /usr/local/bin/p
```

## Config

Copy your `GPT3_API_KEY` to env variable. Your `.profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc` file.

```bash
export GPT3_API_KEY=sk-xxx
```

You'd need to enter your own OpenAI API key Here's how you can get one

1. Go to https://openai.com/api/login
2. Create an account or log into your existing account
3. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys or

Price: `$0.002 per 1,000 tokens`. Single command is about 50 tokens. So in price 1USD you have about `10.000` commands.
Tools with model before `gpt-3.5-turbo` costs 10 times more.

## Features

- [x] Interactive commands
- [x] Colors
- [x] Real time stream
- [x] Overriding system context (`GPT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` env)
- [x] Confirm, Copy and Standard Output modes (`GPT_POST` env)
- [ ] Easy to install (in progress)
    - [x] compilation from source
    - [x] install by bash like nvm
    - [x] docker
    - [ ] snap
    - [x] aur
    - [ ] apt
    - [ ] dnf

## Exceptions

If commands contains `export` or `$` it can't be correctly passed from child process to parent.
So there is fallback applied and these commands are copied if you wanted to execute them by confirmation.

Examples:

```
p change terminal language to english
Text 'export LANG=en_US.UTF-8' was copied to your clipboard

p show my current shell
Text 'echo $SHELL' was copied to your clipboard
```

## Constrains

Ofc GPT3 does not have sense of humor... so

```bash
p say mooo as cow that have colors of rainbow
```

will not work. Correct answer is

```bash
cowsay mooo | lolcat
```

and for

```bash
p show my train in terminal
```

answer is

```bash
Sorry, I do not understand. Can you please provide more details about what you want me to do?
```

instead

```bash
sl
```

## GNU vs MUSL releases

During compilation, you can use static linking (musl) or dynamic (gnu). To use `terminal-clipboard` there is required
need dynamic linking, but it works only on typical linuxes that uses libc. To make docker image small (12 MB) there is
provided `musl` version.

So to be able to use all features (support for GPT_POST=copy), I recommend to use standard `gnu` but if you need docker
or run it on alpine then use `musl`.

## Support

I'm looking for challenging, remote job with rust + typescript + advanced math, so if you appreciate this project, you
can share it, leave star, and recommend me earning employment commission.
